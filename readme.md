#BubbleGraph

Using the Raphael.js library, create a bubble chart.

*Juan Orozco*

Created 12/20/2012

Description:
Bubbles can have relationships where data can dictate the size and color of the bubbles as well as the connector that relates the bubbles together. You can see an sketch of the final result here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9r2ufu3lyrrchos/sketch.jpg

I also have a dependency on a local storage wrapper, but it's only used for debugging logs. Eventually, I'll remove this.

Update Notes:
- *12/20/2012*  Created original protoype version (mainly to learn Raphael). Worked, but with no collision detection and no encapsulation. This version was not captured in git.
- *12/28/2012*  Recreated layout of code.
