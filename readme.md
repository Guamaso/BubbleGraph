#BubbleGraph

Using the Raphael.js library, create a bubble chart.

Created by Me, Juan Orozco thereabouts the 20th of December, 2012.

###Description

Bubbles can have relationships where data can dictate the size and color of the bubbles as well as the connector that relates the bubbles together. You can see a sketch of the final result here:

###Update Notes

- *12/20/2012*  Created original protoype version (mainly to learn Raphael). Worked, but with no collision detection and no encapsulation. This version was not captured in git.
- *12/28/2012*  Recreated layout of code.
- *01/27/2012*  Updated main methods. Updated utility methods. Created simple test. Debugging and updating. Probably worth calling this an alpha release. Yay!
- *09/22/2013*  Been wanting to get back into this and add remaining ideas.  Cleaned up references to stuff I'm not using.

###To Do

(Not in any specific order)

* Convert to CoffeeScript
* Make into a Raphael JS plugin?
* Collision detection
* Auto-position and auto-resize
* Streaming update
* Remove presentation styling - Iz can do with classes?
* Bulk create bubble objects
* Do they have to be bubbles? No. No they don't.
